# PDRPy - Assignment 2

This is a data analysis of various [stackexchange.com](stackexchange.com) communities (bicycles, codegolf, coffee, crypto, gamedev, pets, ukrainian) based on [archive.org](archive.org) archives (see links below). It was written for a university course on data analysis.

There are 3 main areas of focus:

- Most popular programming languages used on [codegolf.stackexchange.com](codegolf.stackexchange.com) (see [notebook](./notebooks/codegolf.ipynb) for results and process)
- Most common pairings of question tags across analysed communities (see [notebook](./notebooks/tags.ipynb) for results and process)
- Answers and threads (see [notebook](./notebooks/lurkers.ipynb) for **surprising** results)
  - quickest and slowest first answers (turns out there are *time travellers* among us)
  - shortest and longest ongoing threads
  - comparing communities
